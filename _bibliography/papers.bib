  abstract={Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins are functionally important and
numerous challenges remain in characterizing them. This project builds upon Nam
biar et al. by improving the DR-BERT model for predicting IDRs in proteins.
We implemented their architecture from scratch and integrated the per-residue
confidence scores (pLDDT) from AlphaFold into the model. Our results show
that incorporating structural information significantly enhances IDR prediction
accuracy. Additionally, our in-silico mutagenesis experiments provide insights
into the role of specific residues in IDR formation. We also made an attempt to
incorporate more sequence information with Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA).
Overall, our work suggests that a combined approach of utilizing sequence and
structural data can yield more accurate IDR predictions.},
