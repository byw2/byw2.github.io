Hi there! I am a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at Princeton University currently advised by [Yuri Pritykin](https://pritykinlab.github.io/). My research focuses on using deep learning to study chromosomal architecture and gene regulation. I am particularly interested about problems at the intersection of machine learning and biology, especially in the context of therapeutics and medicine.

In 2023, I graduated *summa cum laude* from Princeton University with a B.S.E. in Computer Science and a minor in Statistics and Machine Learning. Previously, I have interned at [Recursion Pharmaceuticals](https://www.recursion.com/) and at the [Precision Medical Imaging Lab](https://research.childrensnational.org/labs/precision-medical) at Children's National Hospital.
